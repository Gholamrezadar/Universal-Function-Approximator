# Shallow NNs are Universal Function Approximators!

In this educational project, I'm going to explore the capabilities of shallow neural networks (NNs) as universal function approximators. I'll start by showing how a simple NN with n neurons is a piecewise linear function with n joints and n+1 pieces. Then, I'll demonstrate how a shallow NN can approximate any continuous function (sin(x) for example) to any desired degree of accuracy.
